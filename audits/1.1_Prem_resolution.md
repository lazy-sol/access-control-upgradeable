## Comments ##

### Minor-2. No Check for `role != 0` in `updateRole` ###
To be used as a parent contract for RBAC-based applications, the `AccessControl` contract is originally designed to be
lightweight, which was improved even further in version 1.1 by introducing the `AccessControlCore` contract.

To minimise contract size, we minimise the number of public functions exposed and use a single public function
`updateRole` to add, modify, and delete permissions, including self-revoke.

Mitigated by adding an explicit and very well noticeable comment in the SolDoc for `updateRole` function.

### Notes-1. Version Constraints with Known Issues ###
To allow the use as a parent contract for a wide range of RBAC-based applications, and serve as a Solidity library,
we try to keep pragma constraint as low as possible. This approach maximizes compatibility.

Mitigated by updating the compiler version to 0.8.28 in `hardhat.config.js`.

### Notes-2. Visibility Optimization for Gas Savings 
Visibility modifier was changed from `public` to `external` for functions `isFeatureEnabled`, `isSenderInRole`,
`isOperatorInRole`, `updateFeatures`, `updateRole`, `updateAccessRole`, and `deployNewOwnableToAccessControlAdapter`.

Functions `features`, and `getRole` remain public to be accessible in inheriting contracts.

### Notes-3. Potential Improvement for `FULL_PRIVILEGES_MASK` Assignment ###
Role-based Access Control (RBAC) library, and its AccessControl* contracts are designed to be a long-term, but still
temporary solution for the projects evolving in the direction of the fully decentralized operation. RBAC Lifecycle
assumes that all the permissions are eventually either fully revoked from external participants, or are fully
transitioned to the DAO governance smart contract.

Thus, further improvements to `FULL_PRIVILEGES_MASK` assignments and management are out of scope for the RBAC library.
